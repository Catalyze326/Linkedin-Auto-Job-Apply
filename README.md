# Linkedin Auto Apply Jobs
In order to use this you must download the firefox web driver and put it somewhere in your path. You can find the driver here. https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases

You will also need to install selenium with pip

````
pip3 install selenium
````

Once you have that in your path and you have installed selenium and you answer its questions you should be able to let it run.

I got bored of applying to jobs so I wrote a program to do it for you. It simply asks for your username, password, work experience level, and filters in a text file and then references them wen looking through sites. I might slow it down so that Linkedin does not become suspicious, but right now I think it works.
